This is an inline equation: $x^2=-1$.

This is a centered equation: $$a^2+b^2=c^2.$$

This is a numbered equation: \begin{equation}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}=0.
\label{eq:sample}
\end{equation}

This is an aligned equation: \begin{align}
    \int_{0}^{1}2x\,dx 
    &=x^2\Big|_{x=0}^1\label{eq:sample2}\\
    &=1
\end{align}

This is how to cite the above equation: \eqref{eq:sample} &
\ref{eq:sample2}.
