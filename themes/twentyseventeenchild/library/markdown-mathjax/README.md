## Pagedown + MathJax example
A live Markdown editor example for using [Pagedown](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/) with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).

Coordination between Pagedown and MathJax is based on Stack Exchange's solution, which is a modification of the one written by [Davide Cervone](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11228558/let-pagedown-and-mathjax-work-together/21563171#comment17371250_11231030). See [MJPDEditing](MJPDEditing.js) for details.

The format of this example is based on the [the Pagedown demo](http://pagedown.googlecode.com/hg/demo/browser/demo.html). Creation of this example was inspired by [kerzol's example for Marked + MathJax](../../../../kerzol/markdown-mathjax).
