Hi, everyone!

I'm a second-year PhD student in Mathematics. During the Covid-19, I wrote some programs to get rid of the boring time at home. There are already some excellent websites: 

- MathOverflow and Mathematics StackExchange. They are mainly for Q&A. But what if we want to express ourselves?
- WordPress.com. A good blog community. But it has minor optimiztions for mathematicians, what if we want to write some academic post? Use a conversion tool? Why not write and update directly!
- Overleaf. A great online editor. It is not designed for blogs, what if we want to update our recent status like latest lecture notes?

So, I created this web platform - **a blog community for mathematicians**.  Here, we are free to do all of the above. Hope it can be helpful to our communication, especially in this strange time.

The open source can be found [here](https://github.com/dingc0/mathblog). Feel free to use it and you are encouraged to join me to do this project together.

All the best for 2021,

Ding, C.
